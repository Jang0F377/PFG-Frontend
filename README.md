#### Frontend of the full stack concept app I thought of.

- Made with the Vite.JS framework using Typescript and React.JS
- Utilizes React-Router-Dom for routing.
- Fully mobile responsive

## Technologies used:

- Typescript
- Vite.JS
- React.JS
- React-router-dom
- Tailwind CSS

### Info:

- This is frontend for this project. It has a landing page where users can check out the app. Users can register/login where they can send friend requests or gaming invites (sesh invites) to anyone.

- This is still a work in progress that I am adding to.

#### Roadmap:

1. Friend Request modal
2. Add UI/UX friendly animations
